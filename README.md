# Fully-Connected-to-Conv-Experiment
Experimenting with converting a pretrained Linear layer to a Conv layer using the VGG architecture and the Oxford-IIIT-Pets dataset.

This repo contains the full code and plots from my blog post "Should You Convert Pretrained Fully-Connected Layers to Convolutional Layers?", which will be linked here shortly.

The notebooks can be run top-to-bottom and dependencies can all be easily installed with pip/conda. Notice that setup.py is needed for the experiment notebooks - if you change anything in the setup.ipynb notebook, then download it as a .py file and put it in the same directory as the experiments.
